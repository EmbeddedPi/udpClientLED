udpClientLED
============

A status indicator plugin for a Minecraft server. The Minecraft server can be any machine running a java based server such as Bukkit or Spigot. Status messages are sent from this plugin to a RaspberryPi running the udpServerLED executable jar that needs to be paired with this software.

The combined application displays the status of a Minecraft server on external LEDs using Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.


Usage
=====
This repository is a Maven project based on source code built in Eclipse. If you just want to build it without delving into the code then 
just download the completed plugin .jar from the latest release.
