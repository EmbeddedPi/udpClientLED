        <p>A RaspberryPi based LED notification for minecraft servers (Java). <BR><BR>
	This programme works in conjunction with <a href="http://embeddedpi.github.io/udpServerLED/">udpServerLED</a>.<BR>
        It is based on the original <a href="http://embeddedpi.github.io/piLED/">piLED</a> plugin and runs identical hardware.</p>

<p>udpClientLED/udpServerLED is a traffic light based minecraft server notification system using a RaspberryPi. You will need a RaspberryPi which is connected to the physical hardware described in this guide in addition to a minecraft server. The LEDs indicate whether the server is running or not (red), if someone is logged in locally (amber) or if someone is logged in from outside (green). This has been tested on both Spigot and Glowstone implementations of the minecraft sever but should work on any other server type that will work on the RaspberryPi and accepts plugins.
<BR><BR>udpServerLED is a standalone java application that runs on a RaspberryPi connected to the hardware described below. udpClientLED runs as a standard Minecraft plugin on your Minecraft server. </p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#userguide" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use</h3>

<p>If you are not interested in playing with the code then just download the latest .jar file from the releases section of the project.
After downloading, copy it to your minecraft server plugins folder and follow the hardware guide for the raspberryPi part on the udpServerLED link.</p>
<p>Upon first run the plugin will write a config.yml to its subdirectlroy in your plugins folder. You will need to change the IP address to the one used by your RaspberryPi. This can be done in one of 2 ways.
<UL>Edit the file directly then either restart the server or use the command updateUDPConfig</UL>
<UL>Use the console command (must be OP level) setUDPIPAddress [IPAdress]</UL>
The server must be running on the RaspberryPi first for this change to be recognised.<p>
<p> If you want to play with the source code then download the whole project from the links on the left. It was built in Eclipse using the Maven framework.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#userguide" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Detailed configuration</h3>

<p>The plugin has 3 paramteres that can all be controlled by the either the config.yml file or console commands as described above.</p>
<UL>setUDPIPAdress [IPAddress], sets IP Address of RasberryPi where the udpServerLED appliocation is running. Default 127.0.0.1.</UL>
<UL>setUDPTimeout [milliseconds], sets length of time the plugin will wait for a reply from a newly defined server before giving up. Deafult 5000 or 5 seconds</UL>
<UL>setUDPShortTimeout [milliseconds], sets length of time the plugin will wait for a reply from a previously known good server. Default 500 or 0.5 seconds.</UL>
<UL>listUDPConfig, shows current status of 3 parameters above.</UL>
<UL>updateUDPConfig, attempts to load new parameters from config.yml. If the new parameters are not valid then the the plugin reverts to the previous ones. It should be noted that restarting the server after changing config.yml will have broadly the same effect except that in the case of an error it will revert to the defaults not the last known good value.</UL>

<p>I wrote this, it's my first proper code for well over twenty years (Excel macros notwithstanding) and probably the same for electronics that wasn't work related. It's been fun perhaps with the exception of my woeful attempts to understand Git merges!</p>
